- why we use delete mothod
To delete the data from database 



- create controller 
- create model 
- add timestamp none in model 
- add model into controller
- add controller in api Route
- add delete route in api 

- to delete the data we don't need to transfer data from body part we can just use direct link 
//http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/delete/22

- to get data from id rout should be look like this
Route::delete('delete/{id}',[DeviceController::class,'delete']);
-get this data into controller
