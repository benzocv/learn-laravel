What is route model binding?
- we can directly inject our model in the route is called route model binding. 

- How 

- Create controller 
//php artisan make:controller DeviceController 
- Create a function in it 
- add route 
- Now we need to bind the model with controller thats why we require id from the link 
- we are taking parameter from url as a key 
//Route::get('device/{key}',[DeviceController::class,'index']);
- create model 
//php artisan make:model Device
- import the model inside the controller
- get the parameter in the function
//function index(Device $key){
//    echo $key;
//}

- to use perticular name of the field change the route
//Route::get('device/{key:name}',[DeviceController::class,'index']);
