//lets practice it step by step 


- We need two thing controller and the view 
- Create form in view 
- Create controller
php artisan make:controller UserController 
- create method in controller
function testRequest(Request $req){  //here we are getting data from request 
        return "hello from controller";
    }
- make path of controller in route
route::method_name("users",['UserController'::class,'testRequest']); //this is the format of handling any type of request method method_name is dynamic
- to get data in controller use 
//return $req->input();


//for different method changes you can check user view
